### LA 갈비 (LA Galbi)
> "Galbi" is the Korean word for "rib", and the dish is usually made with beef short ribs. "LA Galbi", also known as a flanken cut, features cut bones peeking out along the long edge. The method was developed by Korean immigrants in Los Angeles to accommodate the thinner rib-eye cut preferred by American butchers. The variation, which enables the marinade to penetrate the meat faster, has since made its way back to South Korea.
