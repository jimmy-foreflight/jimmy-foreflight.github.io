### LA 갈비 (LA Galbi)
![LA_Galbi](./assets/la_galbi.jpeg)
> "Galbi" is the Korean word for "rib", and the dish is usually made with beef short ribs. "LA Galbi", also known as a flanken cut, features cut bones peeking out along the long edge. The method was developed by Korean immigrants in Los Angeles to accommodate the thinner rib-eye cut preferred by American butchers. The variation, which enables the marinade to penetrate the meat faster, has since made its way back to South Korea.

### 김치 (Kimchi)

> A traditional Korean side dish of salted and fermented vegetables, such as napa cabbage and Korean radish. A wide selection of seasonings are used, including gochugaru (Korean chili powder), spring onions, garlic, ginger, and jeotgal (salted seafood), etc.
